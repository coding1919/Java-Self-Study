// Program:
// It is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do
// Which means it is used to talk or interact with computers

// Programming Languages:
// It is used as a languages to write programs
// Computers do not understand our(human) languages as they are a dumb machine who knows only 0 and 1
// So this programming languages helps computer to understand 

// Machine Language:
// A computer's native language
// Which uses 0's and 1's - Binary
// This is hard to use
// Theses are machine dependent - differs from different types of machines
// Every instuction should be written in a machine language before it can be executed
// Which means the instructions which we have written in programming languages must be translated to machine code instructions (binaries)

// Assembly language:
// It was developed to make the programming easier
// It is machine dependent
// It made it easier by adding the keywords
// For ex:
// add 2, 3, result; - This is not directly executed
// At first a program known as ASSEMBLER translates assembly code to machine code


// High Level Language
// A new generation of programming languages
// It uses english words so it makes it easy to use and learn
// It is machine independent so the program can be executed in different machines
// Instructions which is written is called as statement
// The program is called as SOURCE PROGRAM or SOURCE CODE
// For ex:
// result = 2 + 3;
// To translate the source code to machine code we use compiler or interpreter 

// Compiler:
// It translates all the source code to machine code
// Source Code -> Executable
// Source Code - Compiler -> Machine Code - Executor -> Output

// Interpreter:
// Translates each statement into machine code and executes it right away
// Which means it executes line by line like first translates first line of code into machine code and then second line translates to machine code and so on..... 
// Statement - Interpreter -> Output
